This package implements some patches to Sun's Standard Java Doclet to attach
various hooks to certain operations, and allow the user to specify custom
actions to modify the operation of the doclet.

So far, the supported hooks are:

- when rendering the javadoc comment text to HTML

and the supported actions are:

- parse the text as MediaWiki markup
- parse the text as pandoc markdown (TODO)

I originally wanted a doclet that could allow me to use MediaWiki syntax in
javadoc comments, because having to type <p> everywhere is tedious and ugly.
Many people have implemented doclets that do similar things, but most of these
revolved around copying and editing the source for the Standard Java Doclet.

This isn't flexible or extensible, and I've taken a different approach here. I
do modify the Standard Java Doclet, but only in a minimal way, and the rest of
the extended functionality is implemented in separate adapter classes. OOP
after all, is supposed to increase reusability and modularity.

The major advantage with this approach is that it's very easy to add new
features, such as support for different markup languages, and potentially add
hooks to other parts of the operation of the doclet.
